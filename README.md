# Diabetes-Prediction-Machine-Learning
Diabetes prediction using Machine Learning classification technique.

This project aims to predict the likelihood of individuals developing diabetes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health-related factors, the model can potentially help identify individuals at risk and encourage early intervention and preventative measures.

## Technologies Used:

  * Python
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Seaborn
  * Matpplotlib
  * Scikit-learn

## Data:

* Publicly available diabetes dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set))
* Pre-processing steps performed (missing value handling, feature engineering)

## Methodology:

* Analysed the data for statastical Analysis, Missing Values, Correlational analysis.
* Replaced null values with Mean and Median for Normal and Skewed distribution.
* Found outcome distribution and correlation between input parameters.
* Split the data into training and testing dataset and further applied normalization.
* Used support vector machine(SVM) algorithm for prediction.
* Evaluated models using accuracy score with value of 0.75.

## Project Structure:

The project is organized as follows:

* Data: This directory contains the Diabetes dataset in CSV format.
* Notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the Python code used for data analysis and visualization.
* README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, objectives, and instructions for running the code.
* LICENSE: This project is under the MIT License.
